*Pronounced GIF-box*

JIFBOX is a web-based animated GIF photobooth. GIFs are generated in the browser using your webcam, then uploaded to various services that you can choose to enable (currently Dropbox and Tumblr).

**ONLY [GOOGLE CHROME](http://www.google.com/chrome/) IS SUPPORTED AT THIS TIME**

Want to see some GIFs generated by JIFBOX? Check out Sunlight Foundation's [Sunfright Tumblr](http://sunfrightgifs.tumblr.com) from our annual Halloween open house.
